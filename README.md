# Nitrogen Sanity Studio

A minimal Sanity studio built for [Nitrogen](https://github.com/rylanharper/nitrogen). This studio uses [Sanity Connect](https://www.sanity.io/docs/sanity-connect-for-shopify) to synchronize content between a Sanity dataset and your Shopify store.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This studio is a very minimal version of the default `--template shopify` by Sanity. It contains no `productVariant` document type or its corresponding helper functions.

## ⛺️ Sanity Setup

I recommend reading through the [Sanity and Shopify with Hydrogen](https://www.sanity.io/learn/course/sanity-and-shopify-with-hydrogen) guide to learn the basics of how to connect your Sanity dataset with your Shopify store data.

To begin using this studio template, you'll need to add the following environment variables:

```ini
# Sanity
SANITY_STUDIO_PROJECT_ID=gibvd6r4
SANITY_STUDIO_DATASET=production
SANITY_STUDIO_PREVIEW_URL=https://your-site-domain.com
```

### Development

1. Install dependencies using `pnpm install`
2. Start the development server using `pnpm dev`
