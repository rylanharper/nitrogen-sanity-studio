# Nitrogen Sanity Studio

A minimal Sanity studio built for [Nitrogen](https://github.com/rylanharper/nitrogen). This studio uses [Sanity Connect](https://www.sanity.io/docs/sanity-connect-for-shopify) to synchronize content between a Sanity dataset and your Shopify store.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This studio is a very minimal version of the default `--template shopify` by Sanity. It contains no `productVariant` document type or its corresponding helper functions.

## üèì Sanity Setup

I recommend reading through the [Sanity and Shopify with Hydrogen](https://www.sanity.io/learn/course/sanity-and-shopify-with-hydrogen) to learn the basics of how to connect your Sanity dataset with your Shopify store data.
